# T-DEV-810 - Zoidberg 2.0

"Zoidberg 2.0" is the first Artificial Intelligence project for the students with an AI or Big Data major. 
It takes place during the 8th semester of the curriculum.

## Dev Log
A dev log (development log) is a record or journal that developers maintain to document their progress, challenges, decisions, 
and milestones throughout a software development project. It serves as both a historical record and a communication tool.

This repository contains my development log for the Zoidberg 2.0 project - a machine learning system for pneumonia detection from X-ray images.

## Timeline

Start of the project, after reading the project I decided to refresh my [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
knowledge by reading the first chapter of the book *"Python for Data Analysis"* by Wes McKinney the creator of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

The book is freely available on [his website](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)

The Epitech project often includes a bootstrap; a small project to help you discover the basics you'll need for the actual project. I then decided to start working on the bootstrap.

You can find the Jupyter Notebook for the bootstrap [here](./bootstrap/minst.ipynb).
